Enhancing Genetic Analysis Through Functional Abstraction
-----------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
This project focuses on advancing genetic analysis by targeting "functionality"—
differentiating genes based on "levels of abstraction." It computes an adjustable
functional impact index for each gene and organizes them into a database that
reflects their participation in pathways and interactions. This approach distinguishes
high-level integrators from specialized, function-specific genes, offering a collaborative,
open-source tool for exploring complex genetic interactions.

Project Stages:
---------------
Stage 1: Gene Classification & Data Integration
    - Compute the functional impact index for each gene.
    - Integrate additional annotation datasets.
    - Group genes by their abstraction degree (high vs. low).

Stage 2: Analysis & Visualization
    - Develop interactive dashboards and network graphs.
    - Enable users to explore gene interactions and filter data.
    - Provide insights into functional connectivity.

Stage 3: Validation, Community Collaboration & Expansion
    - Validate the model using experimental data and literature.
    - Engage the community for feedback and contributions.
    - Expand the tool’s capabilities for broader systems biology applications.

Glossary & Conventions:
-----------------------
Abstraction Definitions:
    - Genetic Functionality:
      The ability of genes to influence one another, facilitating expression,
      transcriptome formation, and other biological "layers."
    - Functional Impact:
      A measure of the "relevance" of a gene or group of genes based on specific parameters.
    - Layers:
      Structural blocks that compose the genome, representing groups of functionality.
    - Degrees:
      Indices that quantify the level of functional impact of genes.
    - Levels:
      Complexity indicators corresponding to the biological homeostatic functions
      of high-degree genes.

Statistical Indexes:

    - Qualitative Index:
      Derived by defining the desired quality and measuring the functional impact
      of genes using parameters such as connectivity, patterning, and hidden distributions.
      
    - Quantitative Index:
      Measures the intensity of qualitative indexes in different contexts, such as
      structural organization and interaction paradigms.
